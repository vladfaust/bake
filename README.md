## About

Why? Because sometimes [cake]((https://github.com/axvm/cake)) tasks are wanted to be run as binaries.

For example, to run from a Docker container with an already built application: `docker run my-crystal-app bin/cake db:migrate`.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
targets:
  cake:
    main: src/run/cake.cr

dependencies:
  cake-bake:
    github: vladfaust/cake-bake
    version: ~> 0.3.0
```

## Usage

Given `./Cakefile`:

```crystal
require "./src/some_file" # These requires

task :foo do
  puts "bar"
end
```

`./src/run/cake.cr`:

```crystal
require "cake-bake"
Cake.bake("../../Cakefile") # Full path to Cakefile needed to properly resolve requires (see above)

# The Cakefile code will be put here, yay
```

Then execute from `./`:

```shell
$ crystal src/run/cake.cr -- foo
bar

$ crystal build src/run/cake.cr
$ ./cake foo
bar

$ shards build
$ ./bin/cake foo
bar
```
